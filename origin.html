            The band mates came to know each other when they met during an open mic event at a local cafe in Rubyâ€™s hometown. Ruby had just finished her first performance of the night, after which, she crossed paths with Amethyst, a smooth and laid-back guitarist, who usually frequented the open mic night. They instantly clicked and began hanging out together. Eventually, they decided to make music together. When they were jamming out, they realized they needed a drummer to elevate their sound. They posted on their social media that they needed a drummer and Jade reached out. She is an enthusiastic drummer with a distinctive rhythm. The last person to come to the band was Sapphire the groovy bassist who joined them when they were at a neighborhood block party. She was the last person to join the band but still brings a lot to the table with her playful spirit and ability to lift everyone's mood.
